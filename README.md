# Overview

NATO Alliance Countries are building an Alarm System for monitoring Ukraine coastline  and flagging the status of the Black Sea Coast line by sending alert flags (Red, Blue, Green )to the Ukrainian forces.

The Idea for building a Dashboard is simple . NATO alliance countries are aggregating all the images of the coast of Black Sea collected via satellites and surveillance aircrafts. These Images will be processed through an image processing tool called Fifty One . This tool will generate metadata based on the images, detecting the vessels and predicting the kind/category of vessel . For example these vessels could be Commercial Cargos, Commercial Oil Tankers or Warships, Frigates Destroyers  or aircraft carriers. 

All these images are collected constantly and metadata data that is generated via  Fifty One  is merged /loaded to the Mongo Atlas Database. 

As the Data gets loaded  to a mongo Collections it is constantly indexed using Atlas Search to make this data searchable. The Search supports fuzzy logic , synonyms as different Assets (as in Ships ) may have different names in different countries 

Atlas charts will use this real time data to update the dashboard for constant monitoring . A pie chart can report the percentage of non-military vessels vs commercial vessels vs humanitarian vessels like red cross  or peace corps.

Chart will also have a Heat Map of Ukraineâ€™s Black Sea coast line highlighting military activity.

For building this dashboard for the Command Control Center  Nato Alliance Countries have selected a set of tools.
 Fifty One  for AI  processing and metadata generation 
MongoDB Atlas 
Atlas Search
Atlas Charts.


# Justification

_Please explain why you decided to build the application/demonstration for this project. What inspired you? What problems does it solve or how will it make Presales activities easier?_
_What MongoDB competitive differentiators (developer productivity, resiliency, scalability, etc.) does this demonstration showcase?_

# Detailed Application Overview

_Describe the architecture of your application and include a diagram._
_List all the MongoDB components/products used in your demonstration._
_Describe what you application does and how it works_


# Roles and Responsibilities

_List all the team members and summarize the contributions each member made to this project_

# Demonstration Script

_Demonstration script (or link to script) goes here_

_The demonstration script should provide all the information required for another MongoDB SA to deliver your demonstration to a prospect. This should include:_

* _setup/installation steps_
* _step by step instructions on how to give the demonstration_
* _key points to emphasize at each point in the demonstration_
* _any tear down steps required to reset the demonstration so it is ready for the next time_

Object detection algortihms are being used for many real-world use cases. Real-time detection allows all kinds of challenges for collecting and acting on opportunities and threats.

VOXEL51 has leveraged the power of the MongoDB database to help develpoers and data scientists build and optimize object detection and classification algorithms
